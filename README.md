# Using Git and GitHub for Open Ocean Science

## GHRSST Science Team Meeting 2022

## Task 1

Add your information to the `people.json` file to make your name, organization, and GitHub id appear in the *Participants* section of the website.

A [JSON](https://www.json.org/) file uses braces, quotations, and commas to separate out the information. Copy an existing person's information as a template for your own. 

## Task 2

Add your organization and favourite ocean feature to the `places.geojson` file.  This will make a marker appear on the map with the location, type, and description information in a pop up.  If the type is "Organization", the marker will get a different symbol color.

A [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) file is a type of JSON file that is used for encoding a variety of geographic data. 
 Please note that is GeoJSON the coordinates are given by [ *longitude*, *latitude* ].

 The website https://geojson.org has a **very** useful editor that can be used to find the coordinates of any feature by using the tools provided.  Copy and paste the entire `places.geojson` into this editor and then copy it back to GitHub to commit your changes.
